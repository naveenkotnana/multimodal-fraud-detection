# Multi-Modal Behavioral Biometrics Fraud Detection System

This open-source project builds an end-to-end real-time fraud detection engine
using behavioral biometrics, device fingerprinting and hybrid ML models
(Transformer + XGBoost + rule layer).

## Goals
- Achieve 97%+ fraud recall
- <30ms real-time inference latency
- Free & open source stack

## Stack
- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- XGBoost
- ONNX Runtime
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- MLflow
- Evidently
- Hugging Face Spaces

## Roadmap
### Week 1
- Data ingestion and feature engineering
- Synthetic behavioral data generator

### Week 2
- Transformer model training
- XGBoost ensemble

### Week 3
- ONNX optimization + FastAPI API

### Week 4
- Dashboard + deployment to HF Spaces
